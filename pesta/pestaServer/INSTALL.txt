Installing pesta and raya
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RAYA 0.2

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ASP .NET 3.5, 
- ASP .NET MVC, http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=140768&clcid=0x409
- Your favourite versioning tool, eg. Tortoise SVN, http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/
- Access to MS SQL database or SQL database express
- dotnetopenid 3.3.0.9199, http://code.google.com/p/dotnetopenid/
- facebook developer toolkit 2.1, http://www.codeplex.com/FacebookToolkit
- IKVM shindig, http://pesta.googlecode.com/files/IKVM.Shindig.dll.0.1.zip

create 2 folders on your drive somewhere called
- pesta
- raya

Then, check-out the code for each folder at the locations specified below
- pesta, http://pesta.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
- raya, http://raya.svn.codeplex.com/svn/raya

Once you have checked out the above projects, open ands add the following .csproj files into the same solution
- raya
- pestaServer
- pesta
- CustomBuildTasks  (this minifies javascript when building for the first time)

Basically, both pestaserver and raya is dependent on pesta (which builds into a DLL). Open all 3 projects under the same solution.

Select your solution and under "Project -> Set Startup Projects", select "Multiple startup projects" and set
the "Action" for pestaserver and raya as "Start"  

pestaServer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now back to IKVM.Shindig.dll.0.1.zip. Extract the contents of this file somewhere. Next, go to your pestaserver project
and delete the existing references for the following files (as they refer to the incorrect path)
- IKVM.OpenJDK.ClassLibrary
- IKVM.Runtime
- IKVM.Runtime.JNI
- shindig
- pesta

Installing the SQL database
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You either use SQL Server Management Studio or from the command line via sqlcmd to create the database.
Under the raya project, there is a file called raya.sql. This is the database script.

You will first need to create a database called raya. Once this is done, simply execute the script (raya.sql)
from raya.


pestaServer web.config
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are only 3 things you need to do here
1. Point the connection string to the database you've created
2. Specify the address for containerUrlPrefix. This is the address of the "raya project" when it starts up. 
You can update the dynamic port number later.
3. Either specify the tokenMasterKey so that communication between the site and gadget server includes a security token
OR
set allowUnauthenticated to true to bare it all


raya
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the raya project, you will just need to delete and add the following
- pesta
- facebook
- DotNetOpenAuth (from dotnetopenid)
- Microsoft.Xml.Schema.Linq (from facebook project)

You will only need to configure the web.config file. In this file, you will need to
1. Point the connectionString to the database you created above 
2. If you had specify the tokenMasterKey for pesta, you will need to specify the same value here
3. specify the address of the gadget_server, ie. the address that pesta is running on.


And that should be it. If you have any questions, I can be contacted at info at my6solutions dot com
